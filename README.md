# Automated-Galaxy-Classification

This repository contains the implementation for a galaxy image classification project developed as part of a Machine Learning course assignment. The objective is to classify galaxy images into four morphological classes using both traditional machine learning techniques and deep learning models.

## üìå Project Overview

### üî≠ Problem
Classify galaxy images into four categories:
- Spiral  
- Barred Spiral  
- Elliptical  
- Irregular  

### üß† Methods Used
- **Logistic Regression (LR1, LR3)** with color histograms and texture features
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with structured feature inputs
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** using raw image data (RGB and Grayscale)

### üóÇ Dataset
- 11,000 galaxy images (224√ó224 pixels)
- Pre-split into:
  - **Training set:** 10,000 images (2,500/class)
  - **Test set:** 1,000 images (250/class)
